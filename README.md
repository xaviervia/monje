JSTP bindings for MongoDB. Awesome, right?

What is this?
-------------

[JSTP](https://github.com/Fetcher/jstp-rfc) is an asynchronous, JSON based, REST-like protocol for the real time web. [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) is an awesome NoSQL database. 

And **monje** is a tool to interact with the MongoDB via JSTP. **monje** provides, via JSTP, a nice REST-like interface, but faster than HTTP and quite more flexible. 

How to use?
-----------

### Installation

    npm install monje

### API

The API is unstable yet, and some knowledge of JSTP and the [node-jstp](https://github.com/Fetcher/node-jstp) library is needed in order to set up the JSTP Engine, but the endpoint setup is roughly described in the [Roadmap](https://github.com/Fetcher/monje/issues/1) so **monje** can be played with.

In other words, stay tuned!
